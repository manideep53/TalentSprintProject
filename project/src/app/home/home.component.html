              One of the advantages of a CVT is its ability to continuously
              change its gear ratio. This means that no matter what the engine
              speed it, it is always performing at its peak efficiency. CVTs
              often offer better fuel economy as a result, especially when

              Tyre Pressure Sensors (TPMS ... It works by tracking the tyres as
              they revolve. A tyre that is underinflated will have a smaller
              radius than a tyre that's properly inflated, and therefore it will
              make more or irregular turns. This is how the sensor detects that
              the pressure could be low.

              Great shop! Was traveling through town and in a rush to find a
              good mechanic and these guys were above amazing! It's hard to find
              a good honest mechanic and this is one of them! 10/10 would
              recommend.Excellent service from (Repair shop). Found an issue
              that another mechanic did not fix correctly. Price is a bit higher
              than other shops but you definitely get what you pay for and the
              work is excellent.

              Very prompt service and affordable and fair pricing. The owner,
              (Ramesh), was nice and sincere and didn’t make me feel pressured
              to do any work that I couldn’t afford. He even offered to wait for
              me to come pick my car up when I wasn’t sure if I could make it by
              their closing time. This shop was recommended on Angie’s list and
              rightfully so I will definitely bring my car here next time it
              needs repair.
